# What is the command line?

The command line is a text-based way of interacting with your computer. You may hear it called different names, such as the terminal, the shell, or bash. In practice, you can use these terms interchangeably. (If you're curious, though, you can read more about them [in the glossary](glossary.md)). The shell we use (whether terminal, shell, or bash) is a program that accepts commands as text input and converts commands into appropriate operating system functions.  

And yes, "the command line" is also laden with masculine and military metaphors, which is reflective of the history of computing and programming. 

* As Wendy Hui Kyong Chun discusses in ["On Software, or the Persistence of Visual Knowledge" (2004)](https://core.ac.uk/display/161652131), almost all computers (as in human comput-ers) in the US during World War II were young women. Human computers received commands from analysts--predominantly men with the military--that they then had to interpret and act upon the machine. As Chun argues, "computation depends on 'yes, sir' in response to short declarative sentences and imperatives that are in essence commands ... The command line is a mere operating system (OS) simulation" (page 34). The command line (of computers today) receives these commands as text that is typed in.  

* These repositories we are using for our lessons additionally have a lot of racialized terms. [See 'Ditch These Racist Terms From Your Tech Vocabulary.'](https://lifehacker.com/ditch-these-racist-terms-from-your-tech-vocabulary-1844041452)


## Why is the command line useful?

Initially, for some of us, the command line can feel a bit unfamiliar. Why step away from a point-and-click workflow? By using the command line, we move into an environment where we have more minute control over each task we'd like the computer to perform. Instead of ordering your food in a restaurant, you're stepping into the kitchen. It's more work, but there are also more possibilities. 

The command line allows you to...

- Easily automate tasks such as creating, copying, and converting files.
- Set up your programming environment.
- Run programs you create.
- Access the (many) programs and utilities that do not have graphical equivalents.
- Control other computers remotely.

In addition to being a useful tool in itself, the command line gives you access to a second set of programs and utilities and is a complement to learning programming.

What if all these cool possibilities seem a bit abstract to you right now? That's all right! On a very basic level, most uses of the command line are about **showing information** that the computer has, or **modifying or making** things (files, programs, etc.) on the computer. 

## Introduction to the command line

By this point in our academic careers, most of us have figured out some ways we like to interact with computers. Whether that involves avoiding them as much as possible or constantly testing new software, we likely have some ideas about how we feel comfortable getting things done. How would you show a person who had never seen a computer, say [Kimmy Schmidt](https://youtu.be/LIdFa1qLgNQ) or [Brendan Fraser in *Blast from the Past*](https://youtu.be/Xq29uTtKW4M), how to *do* something on your computer? 

Many of us would explain what a screen and a cursor are, and then show how to point and click on icons. This approach relies on a graphical user interface, or GUI (pronounced "gooey!"). 

Annother way to make your computer do things: through the command line. Instead of pointing and clicking, we'll be typing in either git bash (Windows) or terminal (OSX) to tell the computer directly what task we'd like it to perform.
