# What is programming?
"Put simply, programming is giving a set of instructions to a computer to execute. ...While sometimes used interchangeably, programming and coding actually have different definitions."
* "*Programming* is the mental process of thinking up instructions to give to a machine (like a computer)."
    * We have also referred to this as computational thinking. 
* "*Coding* is the process of transforming those ideas into a written language that a computer can understand." 
    * We will be learning to code in Python for this Institute.

## :white_check_mark:** Read the following chapter before this session.**
* [Chapter 2 Hello World](https://ebookcentral-proquest-com.proxy.libraries.smu.edu/lib/southernmethodist/reader.action?docID=5355856&ppg=23) 
*    From [Broussard, Meredith. Artificial Unintelligence: How Computers Misunderstand the World. Cambridge, Massachusetts: The MIT Press, 2018.]
* We will return to concepts brought up in this chapter over the next few days. Keep the following questions in mind:
    * What is happening when computer does analysis?
    * What are we saying when a computer "knows" something? 
      * What does it mean that "Ultimately, data always comes down to people counting things"?
    * Can you describe a time in which a computer behaved in way that was confusing to you and *after going though this repository*, do you have explanation as to why? 
      * What are the affordances and limitations of doing computational analysis for humanities questions? 
  
* "The gap between what we imagine and what computers can actually do is really vast... Often, we talk about computers as being able to do anything, and that’s just rhetoric because ultimately they’re machines, and what they do is they compute, they calculate, and so anything you can turn into math, a computer can do."
