### What we've learned

When we started, we reviewed what text is--whether plain or enriched. We learned that text editors that don't fix formatting of font, color, and size, do allow for more flexible manipulation and multi-program use. If text is allowed to be a string of characters (and not specific characters chosen for their compliance with a designer's intention), that text can be fed through programs and altered with automated regularity. Text editors are different software than Bash (or Terminal), which is a text-based shell that allows you to interact directly with your operating system giving direct input and receiving output. 

Having a grasp of command line basics will not only make you more familiar with how your computer and basic programming work, but it will also give you access to tools and communities that will expand your research.


### What next?

What you have learned will be useful as you move forward through these tutorials. 
* Over the course of this workhsop, you will become familiar with using the [command line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface), [Github](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub) and [Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)).  

* Here is an external [command line tutorial]( https://ryanstutorials.net/linuxtutorial/) if you wish to review and learn more.
